A photorealistic prompt typically includes descriptive language that paints a vivid picture in the reader's mind, allowing them to imagine the scene in great detail. It might include details such as the time of day, weather conditions, camera angle, and other specifics that would help a photographer or artist accurately capture the desired image.

Here are some examples of prompts that can generate photorealistic images in Dall-E, Stable Diffusion, MidJourney and for other image generation models
